<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Thanks for coming to check us out. This website is designed with the mindset to avoid paying other people to customize your car for expensive prices. I previously owned my own custom car shop for 5 years, things went downhill eventually because of the economy. With this in mind, I'm sure there are those of you that would love to know how to do this yourself.</p>
<p>People in today's economy do not want to pay outrageous prices on a hobby or if you are looking to do a couple things to change the appearance of that everyday vehicle. No one likes to get into the same boring vehicle every day and whether it's changing the appearance of the outside or inside it may bring a little self-confidence or pride.</p>
